## Project Overview
Our app, Connectify, will help students who were unable to acquire co-op connect with employers 
in the field and help them acquire industry experience, build connections and get paid.

We wanted to help students with their debt problems, and so we investigated why students were unable 
to find a job after graduation. One of the most glaring issues is getting stuck in the cycle of 
“need experience for a job”, and “need a job for experience”. 

## One Sentence Pitch:
Our project, Connectify, is developing a web application to help students who couldn’t get into 
coop get work experience by connecting them to employers.
